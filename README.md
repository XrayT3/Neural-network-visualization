# Neural Network Visualization

Welcome to the Neural Network Visualization project! This project is designed to help visualize feedforward neural networks (FF NN) specifically for the classification of handwritten digits.

## Introduction

This project provides a graphical interface to visualize the architecture and functioning of feedforward neural networks. It is particularly focused on classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, allowing users to see how the neural network processes and classifies input images.

## Features

Visual representation of neural network architecture
Interactive interface to input handwritten digits
Real-time classification results
Easy to understand and use for educational purposes

## Results

Users can visualize the decision-making process of the neural network in real-time.
